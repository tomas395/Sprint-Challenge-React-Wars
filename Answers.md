1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

<!-- I'd say it's reusable code that changes according to the data that's coming in. useState and useEffect are handy when it comes to fetching data and changing according to the data that's being manipulated to your wishes. -->


2. What does it mean to think in react?

<!-- I'm not sure, but i'm thinking it's when you're trying to create an entire app you think of how you could do all your structuring (html)styling (css) and interactivity (Javascript) in react to build out a website or app? Like you could solve some of those problems quickly using it. -->

3. Describe state.

<!-- state is where you store the property/value to a given component. When the state of the object changes, the entire component changes when it rerenders. -->

4. Describe props.

<!-- props are basically a placeholder that you can name whatever you want that pass function arguments to the object you're putting it in. as long as the names are consistent, you'll get your desired outcome. -->

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

<!-- it's something that changes something outside of the scope of the function it's being put in. To sync effects you'd need to use hooks or a useEffect?  -->
